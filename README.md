## Introduction
This project provides the below monitoring capabilities
- Showcase the difference between monitored and non-monitored cluster
- Container insight and health monitoring for AKS resources
- Help in identification of bug and root cause analysis

## Azure Monitor for Containers
This solution has been used to create an AKS monitoring scenario in the contoso demo environment, and can also be used by users to create replica in their own azure environment.

## Prerequisites

* Owner/Contributor with User access administrator permission to an azure subscription
* Contributor permission on Azure DevOps project
* Client id and secret from service principal and Object id from enterprise application is required in azure environment

## Setup

1. Clone/Fork the repository [ContainerMonitoring](https://contosohotelsdev.visualstudio.com/ContosoHotels/_git/ContainerMonitoring) to your Azure DevOps project.
- How to fork a repository

2. Use an existing or create a new service connection for azure subscription authentication with devops. 

    ![steps to create new service connection](./deploymentStepGIFs/stepsToCreateServiceConnection.gif =1000x)

3. Update service connection in _Container-monitoring-environment.variables.yml_.

    ![Steps to update service connection in variable file](./deploymentStepGIFs/updateSPNInVariableFile.gif =1000x)


4. Create a new azure devops build pipeline in your project with existing yaml file within cloned/fork repo.

    ![steps to create pipeline](./deploymentStepGIFs/stepsToCreatePipeline.gif =1000x)


5. Enter below variables as pipeline secret variables

    - **ContosoSH360ClusterSPClientId** - Client id of an azure spn
    - **ContosoSH360ClusterSPObjectId** - Object id from enterprise application
    - **ContosoSH360ClusterSPClientSecret** - Client secret of an azure spn
    - **chVmAdminPassword** - Windows profile user password
    - **chVmAdminUser** - Windows profile username

    ![steps to add pipeline variables](./deploymentStepGIFs/stepsToAddPipelineVariables.gif =1000x)

6. **Optional:** Update variables in Container-monitoring-environment.variables.yml variables file to match your environment naming convention

## Pipeline execution

1.  Run the pipeline and add prefix based on your environment naming convention
