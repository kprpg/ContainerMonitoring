# Introduction
This demo scenario showcase below monitoring capabilities
- Showcase the difference between monitored and non-monitored Azure kubernetes cluster
- Health monitoring of AKS cluster including both container insights and managed Prometheus.
- Publishing metrics from Prometheus workspace to Azure managed Grafana

# Azure Monitor for Containers
This solution has been used to create an AKS monitoring scenario in the contoso demo environment, and can also be used by users to create replica in their own azure environment.

# Implementation of Managed Prometheus
This solution has also been used for Implementation of Managed Prometheus By Seclecting a appropriate flag " PrometheusDeployment" we can deploy Azure managed prometheus for the same scenario which is powerful tool that enables you to monitor and manage your applications and infrastructure more effectively, providing you with real-time insights and helping you quickly identify and resolve issues and also visualize data using Grafana dashboards.

# How to deploy in your environment (Do-It-Yourself)
- [Clone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/clone?view=azure-devops&tabs=visual-studio-2022) the repository [ContainerMonitoring](https://contosohotelsdev.visualstudio.com/ContosoHotels/_git/ContainerMonitoring) to your Azure DevOps project.

- Create or use existing [service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal)

- Use an existing or create a new service connection for azure subscription authentication with devops. 

    ![steps to create new service connection](./deploymentStepGIFs/stepsToCreateServiceConnection.gif =1000x)

- Update service connection in _Container-monitoring-environment.variables.yml_.

    ![Steps to update service connection in variable file](./deploymentStepGIFs/updateSPNInVariableFile.gif =1000x)

- Create a new azure devops build pipeline in your project with existing yaml file within cloned/fork repo.

    ![steps to create pipeline](./deploymentStepGIFs/stepsToCreatePipeline.gif =1000x)


- Enter below variables as pipeline secret variables

    - **ContosoSH360ClusterSPObjectId** - Object id from enterprise application
    - **chVmAdminPassword** - Windows profile user password
    - **chVmAdminUser** - Windows profile username

    ![steps to add pipeline variables](./deploymentStepGIFs/stepsToAddPipelineVariables.gif =1000x)

- **Optional:** Update variables in Container-monitoring-environment.variables.yml variables file to match your environment naming convention

## How to run pipeline

- Run the pipeline and enter prefix based on your environment naming convention

    ![steps to run pipeline](./deploymentStepGIFs/stepsToRunPipeline.gif =1000x)

- Parameter Selection

    * **AKS Cluster Version** - Use supported version for your region

        To find out what versions are currently available for your subscription and region, please refer [AKS cluster supported versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions?tabs=azure-powershell#azure-portal-and-cli-versions).

# Contribution Workflow

Hereâ€™s how it generally works:
